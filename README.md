# BirdCLEF Audio Classification Notebook

This repository contains a notebook for bird sound classification using deep learning techniques and audio preprocessing pipelines. The project is built around the [BirdCLEF](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/birdclef-2025) dataset and aims to classify 206 different bird species from audio recordings.

##  Project Highlights

-  **Audio Preprocessing**: 
  - Noise reduction using `noisereduce`
  - Voice Activity Detection (VAD) using Silero VAD
  - Conversion to Mel spectrograms

-  **Modeling**:
  - Feature extraction using pre-trained [YAMNet](https://tfhub.dev/google/yamnet/1)
  - Feedforward Neural Network with PyTorch
  - Class balancing via `class_weight`

-  **Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy, classification report, and recall score
  - Train-test split used for validation

##  Requirements

Make sure the following packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib torch torchaudio noisereduce scikit-learn tensorflow_hub
```

---

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ri-Var/BirdCLEF-audio-classification-notebook.git
   cd BirdCLEF-audio-classification-notebook
   ```

2. Open `Classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.

3. Run all cells sequentially. Ensure internet access for downloading the YAMNet model and Silero VAD.

## Results

The model is evaluated on a train-test split using metrics like:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- Precision
- Classification Report
